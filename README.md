## RoSIP Scale

**RoSIP (Robot Social Interaction Potential Scale)** is an appearance-based measure that captures how users infer a robot's potential for social interaction from its visual affordances.

### Dimensions

The scale consists of **10 items** measuring two dimensions:

**Perceptual Potential** - User's belief that the robot can receive information from the environment:
- *Perceptual Reception*: Can the robot detect what is happening around it?
- *Perceptual Expression*: Can the robot clearly show when it notices something?

**Behavioral Potential** - User's belief that the robot can generate socially meaningful responses:
- *Social Interactivity*: Can the robot autonomously decide how to interact? Can it interpret speech and behavior?

## Database

The database contains:
- 300 robot images with standardized appearance annotations
- RoSIP scores (Perceptual Potential, Behavioral Potential, Total)
- Percentile rankings for all metrics
